        Trac ticket number\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n#### Branch description\r\nThe page `contributing/writing-code/submitting-patches.html`
        has been updated with this change. The issue was that the instructions on
        how to assign a ticket to yourself was out of date and confusing for a first
        time user of TRAC. This PR updates the sentence to accurately explain where
        to click on the page to assign a ticket.\r\n\r\nThe original instruction which
        is out of date with the UI:\r\n>![The current instructions which do not mention
        the ''Modify ticket'' button](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70790108-e997-4a87-9fd7-4334ca06f07e)\r\n\r\nThe
        new instruction which is more accurate:\r\n>![The updated sentence that mentions
        the ''Modify ticket'' button](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb58bf68-36f1-450a-bdae-1fa39bec966d)\r\n\r\n\r\n####
